## Visitors:
This is a place for you to learn about us, find out what projects we are working on, and connect with us through our social media links below!

## Udacity alumni and GWG scholars:
This is our hub to stay connected and collaborate on projects together. If you would like to participate, follow these steps:

1. Fork this repo or edit this README directly with the connection info that you would like to share (use the same format as in the first list item in the ***Who we are*** section.)
2. Once you've pushed your code to Github or saved the README directly, submit a pull request to this repo with your new fork. We will merge it ASAP! (it's actually just me at the moment... help!)
3. If you would like to help maintain this group please let me know! Contact me on Slack and I'll set you up with admin privileges.
4. Start your own projects here! Let's build some amazing things! We have a large pool of people with lots of different skills. This can be a great way to get even more experience working as a team as well as get help on ideas that you have!
5. Open to all suggestions on what we can make this so let's begin!
